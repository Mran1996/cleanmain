        <p class="paragraph">Dear Valued Customer,</p>

        <p class="paragraph">You deserve to be home with your family, not stuck waiting on slow mail or trying to fight your case alone. We understand how difficult it is to navigate complex legal documents with limited resources and little support. You are not forgotten, and we are here to help you take the next step forward.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Ask AI Legal was created to provide fast, affordable, and reliable legal document assistance using only one fifteen-minute phone call with your family. During your call, your family can open our website and answer a short set of questions based on your conversation. From that information, we create a custom legal document written specifically for your situation. We do not use templates. Every document is crafted individually.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">We offer two service options to meet your needs:</p>

        <div class="option-title">Option 1: Fast-Track Intake Plan ($199)</div>
        <p class="option-content">You call your family, and they answer the intake questions on our website. We use the information from that call to create a custom legal document such as a motion, letter, or statement. We send the finished document to your family so they can print and mail it to you. This option is best when you already know what you need to file.</p>

        <div class="option-title">Option 2: Full Service Legal Response ($499)</div>
        <p class="option-content">Your family completes a short questionnaire with your case number and the filing you need us to respond to. We take over from there. We retrieve the court document directly from the court, gather the necessary information, draft a complete legal response, and mail the final, ready-to-sign document directly to you in your facility. This option is best for complex motions or when you want everything handled from start to finish.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Every document we create is an opportunity to move your case forward. If your family would like to help you get started, simply tell them to visit www.askailegal.com during your next call.</p>
