**Ask AI Legal™ – Your Legal Assistant, Your Rights, Your Future**

Dear Friend,

I'm writing to introduce you to **Ask AI Legal™**, an AI-powered legal assistant designed to help you understand your legal rights, prepare legal documents, and access critical legal information – all from wherever you are.

**How Ask AI Legal Can Help You:**

Whether you're dealing with post-conviction motions, appeals, sentence reductions, civil rights violations, prison conditions complaints, or any other legal matter, Ask AI Legal can:

✓ **Explain your legal rights** in plain language  
✓ **Generate legal documents** – motions, appeals, complaints, and filings tailored to your situation  
✓ **Access current case law** – searches for up-to-date legal precedents and recent court decisions  
✓ **Provide step-by-step guidance** based on your specific circumstances  
✓ **Work at your own pace** – no pressure, take the time you need

**Why This Matters:**

The legal system shouldn't be a mystery. Having access to reliable legal information shouldn't depend on your ability to afford expensive attorneys. Ask AI Legal puts professional-grade legal assistance at your fingertips, helping you advocate for yourself and pursue justice.

**How to Use It:**

Simply describe your legal situation, and the AI will guide you through understanding your options and preparing the necessary documents. The system can help you draft everything from simple letters to complex legal motions.

**Please Share This Information:**

**You are welcome and encouraged to share this letter and information about Ask AI Legal with others.** Consider:

• Sharing with fellow residents who may need legal assistance  
• Posting this letter in your facility's law library  
• Discussing it with legal aid organizations or paralegals  
• Passing it along to family members dealing with legal issues

Knowledge is power, and sharing resources helps everyone in our community access justice.

**Important Note:**

While Ask AI Legal is a powerful tool that can help you understand your rights and prepare legal documents, it does not replace the advice of a licensed attorney. For complex matters, consulting with a qualified attorney is always recommended. However, when that's not possible, Ask AI Legal can be an invaluable resource.
